# Winter Break Project

The winter break will likely have your first experience with stepping away from coding long enough to feel a little disoriented when you come back to it. Keep in mind that it's important to strike the balance between going cold turkey on coding and burning out from self-prescribed three-day hackathons.

The goal of this project is to give you something to work on over the break and to interact with your fellow students while we are out of class.

### Tasks for the Break

- [Lightbulb Challenge](https://classroom.github.com/a/k8AsqhFv)
- [Week 3 Assessment](https://classroom.github.com/a/B0gsE7R1)

### Lightbulb Challenge

This challenge has three pieces:

1. The code: a React project.
2. Code reviews: reviewing your cohortmates code and giving feedback and suggestions.
3. Show and tell: a short presentation about your experience with the project.

### Part 1: The Code

The link above will create a GitHub repository for you with a start React application. Please review the README for proper setup and process notes. User stories and branches have been noted.

**Branch names have been provided in the README. These are the only branches you will need to use.**

Once you are complete with the collection of user stories related to a given branch, you will:

1. Add, commit, and push your code up to your repository.
2. Create a Pull Request for the branch that is complete.
3. Post the link of the Pull Request in the slack 2022h Channel.
4. Tag classmates to review your code.
   - If after 24 hours your PR has not been approved, tag instructors with your PR url.
5. Once your code has been reviewed, merge your PR and delete the old branch from GitHub.
6. Checkout the next branch on your local repository. Always pull from main before checking out a new branch.
7. Keep coding!

Be mindful to promptly push your code for assignments because **your peers will need time to read your code and provide feedback.**

### Part 2: Code Reviews

Building your code reviewer muscle is an important skill. Know that your input, at any level, is valuable. Giving code reviews affords you the opportunity to read code and understand all the things that go into making code beautiful.

Each person will be responsible for reviewing three Pull Requests for their classmates. This includes checking their code for:

- Functionality
- Proper syntax
- Pseudo code
- Formatting and indentation
- Make sure that the associated branch matches the work that is done

**Code Review Code of Conduct**

- [LEARN Code of Conduct](https://www.learnacademy.org/code-of-conduct/)
- Optional Reading: [Code Review Code of Conduct](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/code-reviews-code-of-conduct-6c78a026ed35)
- Goal: provide feedback that may help the author's code be more legible and performant, easy to read, and uses best practices. If the code is outstanding, leave comments that indicate what you appreciated about it.
- Be respectful. Code is personal because people have worked very hard on it. Exercise humbleness in your feedback. Be suggestive, not decisive.
- Expectation of minimum three comments on each GitHub pull request.

**Code Review Checklist**

Consider improvements that can be made to:

- Variable naming. Are they descriptive and accurate? If not, what is an example of a fitting name? Does it help with understanding the code?
- Formatting. Is it helping or hurting your ability to understand the code quickly?
- Comments. Are they helpful and accurate?
- Logic. Is there another way to achieve the same behavior? What are the pros and cons of doing it that way?
- Compliments. What does the code do well?

**Code Review Logistics**

1. When a classmate posts a link for a code review in slack add an emoji of the :eyes: (aka taking-a-look) to the post to indicate you are actively reviewing the code.
2. On the PR page there is a tab called `files changed`.
3. This tab should have a record of all the code changes made to the branch.
4. Leave comments on the code it by pressing the `+` button that appears next to the code line number.
5. Thoroughly review the code using the process listed above.
6. When you are done click the "Finish your review" green button at the top right of the page. This will open a text box where you can leave general feedback and notes. Select "comment" and submit.
7. Once you have left a comment the PR on Slack 2022h leave a :white-check-mark: (aka completed) emoji on the post.

### Part 3: Show and Tell

Prepare a three-minute show and tell for the cohort. Pick three of the following topics to help structure your presentation. Each student will be expected to showcase their project's UI and some of the code.

**Topics**

- Talk about errors you encountered in your lightbulb challenge. Show a screen shot of the error message. Talk about the steps you went through to find your solution.

- Talk about feedback you left on your code reviews. Why did you feel this feedback was important? What was your experience in providing feedback?

- Talk about new vocabulary words, terms you learned, or relearned and encountered while working on projects. These can be words you are familiar with in layman's terms but are used differently in the software/web development context or words that are completely new to you.

- Talk about refactoring you did. Show your commits. Why were these changes important? What problem(s) were you trying you solve?

- Talk about the pseudo coding process. What was your approach to pseudo coding and planning for this project? What would you change or keep the same for future projects?
